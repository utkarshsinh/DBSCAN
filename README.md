# DBSCAN
## Description:

Devised and executed a comprehensive evaluation plan for the DBSCAN algorithm to ensure model stability and accuracy in breast cancer diagnosis.
Implemented a stability-based evaluation by shuffling the dataset 10 times and running the DBSCAN model on each variation, calculating intrinsic and extrinsic metrics such as the Silhouette Coefficient and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI).
Analyzed the mean and standard deviation of the scores across iterations to assess the stability of the clustering outcomes.
Conducted rigorous cross-validation using 10 data subsets to validate the performance of the DBSCAN model, maintaining the same hyperparameters for consistency.
Identified and reported potential factors for the suboptimal NMI and Silhouette Coefficient scores, including high data dimensionality, preprocessing steps, and inherent dataset characteristics.
## Key Achievements:

Ensured the robustness of the clustering model through methodical stability and cross-validation testing, vital for medical diagnostic accuracy.
Provided critical insights into model performance limitations, paving the way for further refinement and research.
